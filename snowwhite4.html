<h1> Snow white part 4</h1>
<h3>The seven dwarfs:</h3>
<h4>The cottage:</h4>
<li>Little snow-white was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some vegetables and bread from
each plate and drank a drop of wine out of each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one
only.
<li>Then, as she was so tired, she laid herself down on one of the little beds, but none of
them suited her, one was too long, another too short, but at last she found that the seventh
one was right, and so she remained in it, said a prayer and went to sleep. 
<h3> thank you.
